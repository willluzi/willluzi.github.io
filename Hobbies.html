        <P>I have many hobbies, I have four main hobbies when Im trying to stay busy one of them being hanging out with family and friends and enjoying quality time with close ones. Other hobbies I take upon are playing basketball at the park or playing football or baseball with my buddies, lastly one hobby that I am very lucky to have the opporunity to be able to do is go fishing on my fathers boat during the summer and taking a bunch of my friends out fishing and enjoying nature at its finest.</P>
