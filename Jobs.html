        <H1>Jobs</H1>
        <p> In the Summer of 2015, when I had first turned 16 years old and had been able to apply for a job I had applied at a local pizza resturant. In my town this is a very well known pizza franchise that streches through southeastern Connecticut. At this job I had been treated very well by my co-workers, my job at the resturant had been to bus tables, and also clean dishes. For a first job this had been everything I have ever wanted the work was busy and difficult at sometimes but the reward of seeing customers leave happy and full was worth it. I had worked at this pizza place for the rest of the summer into the winter and into the summer. In the Fall of 2016, I had to make a commitment to play soccer for the Varisty team at my school. In the winter I had an opprotunity to work at the world's largest indoor go-karting faculty in the world, this job was very easy and very boring at the same time. My job was too watch the track and make sure everybody was driving safe and didnt break any rules while on the Track. I had worked there for a full year and then I had to notify them that I was going off too college. Next summer I am planning on either becoming a bar-back at a local bar in my town or working for the town as a gate attendant a beaches in my community.</p>
