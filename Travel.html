        <p> I have only traveled out of the country once and that had been when I was 12 years old and my fmaily and I had gone to Cancun, Mexico. This experience was very eye-opening and life changing by the fact that I was able to go to the Mayan Ruins and see first hand the cuture of the natives living there, although I had onnly been there was a week I was able to capture many memories that stick with me today. This upcming summer I am planning on going to visit my aunt in Huntington Beach, California. I had been to California once before but I had been six years old and barely have any memories of going so this time Im sure too adventure out and really see what life is like on the west-coast. I also would like to study abroad in Italy becuase I have distant relatives that live in Fano, Italy. Many of my older cousins have already had the opprotunity to visit and they say its a must go to and its very beautiful.</p>
